## Steam Store Search

SSS (Steam Store Search) is a command line utility to search Steam's store and output results.

It can be used in 2 ways. You can either type "steamstoresearch" to initiate a prompt asking you for what you want to search, or you can type a phrase after the command to search for that phrase instead of prompting.

You can install it with `
npm install -g steamstoresearch
`
